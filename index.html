	<h4>Alex Gass...</h4>
	<p class="thought1">
		Welcome to my page....take a look around. My name is Alex and I currently live in Austin, Texas. I'm a native Texan but big on travel and spent nearly four years living in the UK for work. 

		I am back in Austin and attending grad school at the University of Texas. Planning to move to Hong Kong in January for school and looking to explore future opportunities globally. Interested in talking travel, golf, sports - hit me up. Thanks for the visit.
